# DilutionsPhaseTwo - Comprehensive Architecture Recommendations

Based on the analysis of all requirements documents, this document provides consolidated architecture recommendations for the MDF (Markdown Dilutions Funding) retail system.

## Executive Summary

The DilutionsPhaseTwo system is a retail/fashion industry platform for managing style-based funding contracts, OCS (Original Cost Sheet) projections, and MDF contract allocations across Inline and E-commerce channels. The system has a strong foundation in data modeling and business logic but requires significant expansion in API design, security, and user experience areas.

### Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**: Excellent data model for retail operations, clear business logic, strong audit trail design
- **Critical Gaps**: API specifications, security model, user interface design
- **Risk Level**: Medium without addressing identified gaps

## 1. Technical Architecture Recommendations

### 1.1 API Architecture - CRITICAL PRIORITY

The backend requirements completely lack API specifications. Recommend:

```
Technology Stack:
- REST API with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- GraphQL for complex queries (optional)
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting and CORS configuration

Required API Endpoints:
GET/POST   /api/v1/styles              - Style management
GET/POST   /api/v1/items               - Item management  
GET/POST   /api/v1/ocs-contracts       - OCS contract CRUD
GET/POST   /api/v1/mdf-contracts       - MDF contract lifecycle
GET/POST   /api/v1/allocations         - Allocation management
GET/POST   /api/v1/ledger-entries      - Transaction recording
GET        /api/v1/balances            - Real-time balance queries
POST       /api/v1/contracts/upload    - File upload with OCR
GET        /api/v1/audit-trail/{id}    - Audit history
```

### 1.2 Security Architecture - CRITICAL PRIORITY

No security requirements were defined. Implement:

```
Authentication & Authorization:
- OAuth 2.0 / JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management for service-to-service
- Session management with appropriate timeouts

Data Security:
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- Field-level encryption for PII/financial data
- Database connection encryption

Compliance:
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Security headers and CSRF protection
```

### 1.3 Database Architecture Enhancements

Build on the strong existing schema with:

```sql
-- Add missing security and compliance features
ALTER TABLE "LedgerEntry" ADD COLUMN updated_by TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "LedgerEntry" ADD COLUMN compliance_reviewed_by UUID;
ALTER TABLE "LedgerEntry" ADD COLUMN regulatory_approval_ref VARCHAR(100);

-- Implement row-level security
ALTER TABLE "LedgerEntry" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Add data retention policies
ALTER TABLE "LedgerEntry" ADD COLUMN retention_date DATE;

-- Performance optimization with partitioning
CREATE TABLE "LedgerEntry_2024" PARTITION OF "LedgerEntry" 
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```
