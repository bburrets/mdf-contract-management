# Introduction

This document outlines the MVP-focused architecture for MDF Contract Management System, emphasizing simplicity, reliability, and rapid delivery over complex features. It serves as the technical foundation for an 8-week development cycle that delivers core automation value while avoiding over-engineering.

This pragmatic approach focuses on proven technologies and simple patterns that can evolve as business needs are validated through actual usage.

## MVP Approach

This is a simplified implementation focusing on the core automation goal: reducing MDF contract processing from 3-5 days to 1-2 days through reliable OCR and Style matching, with manual processes for edge cases.
