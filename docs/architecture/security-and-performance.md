# Security and Performance

Basic security and performance considerations for MVP deployment.

## Security Requirements

**Authentication Security:**
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Basic rate limiting on auth endpoints

**Data Protection:**
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- File upload validation and virus scanning

**Access Control:**
- Simple role-based access (Admin/User)
- Basic audit logging for financial transactions

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Next.js automatic optimization
- Image optimization for contract previews
- Basic caching for API responses

**Backend Performance:**
- Database connection pooling
- Query optimization for balance calculations
- Basic API response caching

**Database Performance:**
- Proper indexing on query columns
- Query optimization for reporting
- Regular maintenance tasks
