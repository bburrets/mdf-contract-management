```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- **PDF corruption or unreadable format:** Fallback to manual entry with clear error messaging
- **OCR timeout or service failure:** Graceful degradation to basic text extraction or manual entry
- **Style matching returns zero results:** Manual search interface with "create new Style request" escalation
- **Network failure during submission:** Auto-save draft with retry mechanism and offline indication
- **Concurrent user editing same contract:** Version conflict detection with merge assistance
- **Invalid channel allocation amounts:** Real-time validation with clear error descriptions

**Notes:** The flow emphasizes user agency at each validation point while providing intelligent assistance. Critical decision points (Style confirmation, channel allocation) require explicit user action rather than automatic progression. Error recovery paths maintain user progress and provide clear next actions.

## Component Library / Design System

**Design System Approach:** Custom component library optimized for financial data entry and workflow applications, with Next.js/React components built for reusability and consistency. Focus on form components, confidence indicators, status widgets, and data visualization elements specific to contract processing workflows.

### Core Components

#### Confidence Score Widget

**Purpose:** Display AI confidence scores with consistent visual indicators across Style matching and detection results

**Variants:** 
- **Inline Badge:** Small percentage with color coding (≥90% green, 70-89% yellow, <70% red)
- **Detailed Card:** Expanded view with reasoning text and confidence bar
- **Mini Indicator:** Dot-style indicator for dashboard cards and lists

**States:** Loading (animated), High Confidence (green), Medium Confidence (yellow), Low Confidence (red), Error (gray with warning icon)

**Usage Guidelines:** Always pair confidence scores with user action capability - never show confidence without allowing user override or review

#### Contract Type Toggle

**Purpose:** Multi-state toggle for Inline/E-Com/Both channel selection with dynamic form integration  

**Variants:**
- **Single Select:** Radio button style for exclusive selection
- **Multi Select:** Checkbox style allowing Both Channels combination  
- **Detection Override:** Shows detected state with manual override capability

**States:** Detected (blue outline), User Selected (solid color), Available (default), Disabled (grayed)

**Usage Guidelines:** When user changes selection, connected form sections should animate in/out with smooth transitions. Both Channels selection should clearly indicate two separate commitments.

#### Dynamic Form Section

**Purpose:** Collapsible form sections that appear/disappear based on contract detection and user selection

**Variants:**
- **Detected Section:** Pre-populated with extracted data, highlighted fields
- **Manual Section:** Empty fields when user adds non-detected contract type  
- **Validation Section:** Error states with inline messaging and correction guidance

**States:** Hidden, Expanding (animation), Active, Validating, Error, Success

**Usage Guidelines:** Sections should maintain scroll position when expanding/collapsing. Auto-save should trigger on field changes with visible confirmation.

#### Style Selection Dropdown  

**Purpose:** Searchable dropdown with confidence scoring for Style Number selection and alternatives

**Variants:**
- **Pre-selected:** Shows detected Style with confidence badge
- **Search Mode:** Autocomplete with filtering by season, business line  
- **Alternative List:** Ranked alternatives with reasoning when expanded

**States:** Loading, Pre-selected, Searching, Results Available, No Results, Error

**Usage Guidelines:** Pre-selected option should be clearly marked as AI suggestion. Manual search should be easily accessible. OCS status indicators required for compliance validation.

#### Status Indicator Badge

**Purpose:** Consistent status visualization across contracts, Styles, and reconciliation states

**Variants:**
- **Contract Status:** Active (green), Closed (yellow), Finalized (blue)
- **Balance Status:** Available (green), Low (yellow), Overdrawn (red)  
- **Processing Status:** Draft (gray), Processing (blue), Complete (green), Error (red)

**States:** Static display, Animated (for manual refresh updates), Interactive (clickable for details)

**Usage Guidelines:** Color coding must meet accessibility contrast requirements. Include text labels alongside color indicators. Animation should be subtle for balance updates.

## Branding & Style Guide

### Visual Identity

**Brand Guidelines:** Clean, professional interface reflecting enterprise financial software standards with emphasis on clarity and trust through consistent typography, appropriate use of color for status indicators, and integration with FAMBrands visual identity where appropriate.

### Color Palette

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Primary | #1E40AF | Primary actions, navigation highlights, focus indicators |
| Secondary | #6366F1 | Secondary buttons, links, accent elements |
| Accent | #059669 | Success states, positive balances, completed actions |
| Success | #10B981 | Confirmations, validation success, active contracts, confidence indicators ≥90% |
| Warning | #F59E0B | Attention needed, medium confidence 70-89%, pending states |
| Error | #EF4444 | Errors, critical alerts, confidence <70%, overdrawn balances |
| Neutral | #6B7280, #F3F4F6, #E5E7EB | Text, borders, backgrounds, disabled states |

### Typography

#### Font Families
- **Primary:** Inter (web-safe, excellent for data-heavy interfaces)
- **Secondary:** Source Sans Pro (fallback, high legibility for forms)
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono (for Style numbers, amounts, technical data)

#### Type Scale
| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---------|------|---------|------------|
| H1 | 32px | 600 | 1.25 |
| H2 | 24px | 600 | 1.33 |
| H3 | 20px | 500 | 1.4 |
| Body | 16px | 400 | 1.5 |
| Small | 14px | 400 | 1.43 |

### Iconography

**Icon Library:** Heroicons v2 (consistent with Tailwind CSS ecosystem, professional appearance)

**Usage Guidelines:** Icons should be 16px or 20px for inline use, 24px for standalone actions. Use outline style for default states, solid style for active/selected states. Confidence indicators use custom percentage badges with color coding.

### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:** 12-column CSS Grid with 24px gutters, responsive breakpoints at 768px (tablet) and 1024px (desktop)

**Spacing Scale:** 4px base unit - 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px for consistent spacing throughout the interface

## Accessibility Requirements

**Compliance Target:** WCAG 2.1 AA standard ensuring keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast ratios, and alternative text for all visual elements, critical for users with diverse accessibility needs in operations environment.

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components
- Focus indicators: 2px solid outline with 2px offset, high contrast color (#1E40AF) visible on all interactive elements
- Text sizing: Minimum 16px for body text, scalable to 200% without horizontal scrolling

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements accessible via Tab, Enter, Space, and Arrow keys with logical tab order
- Screen reader support: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels for complex widgets, live regions for dynamic updates
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px x 44px clickable areas for tablet dashboard interfaces

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for all images, charts, and visual indicators including confidence scores
- Heading structure: Logical H1-H6 hierarchy for screen reader navigation, skip links to main content
- Form labels: Explicit labels for all form inputs, error messaging associated with relevant fields

### Testing Strategy

Automated accessibility testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline using axe-core, manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers (NVDA, JAWS), regular accessibility audits during development sprints, and user testing with accessibility-dependent users during beta phase.

## Responsiveness Strategy

**Strategic Focus:** Desktop-first approach recognizing that 95% of contract processing occurs at workstations, with simplified tablet/mobile interfaces for monitoring only - no financial processing on inadequate devices.

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Phones for alerts and basic balance lookup only |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | iPads for dashboard monitoring and status review only |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Primary workstations for all contract processing |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large monitors for power users and multi-contract workflows |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** 
- **Desktop/Wide:** Full-featured side-by-side PDF + form layout optimized for accuracy and efficiency
- **Tablet:** Read-only dashboard with charts, balances, and contract status - no form entry or processing
- **Mobile:** Basic balance lookup interface with alerts and notifications acknowledgment

**Navigation Changes:** 
- **Desktop/Wide:** Complete navigation with all processing workflows accessible
- **Tablet:** Simplified dashboard navigation focused on monitoring and reporting
- **Mobile:** Minimal interface for quick status checks and alert management

**Content Priority:** 
- **Desktop/Wide:** Complete feature set with comprehensive contract processing capabilities
- **Tablet:** Monitoring only - Style dashboard, balance visibility, status tracking, audit trail viewing
- **Mobile:** Critical information only - balance queries, funding alerts, basic contract status

**Interaction Changes:**
- **Desktop/Wide:** Mouse/keyboard optimized with full processing workflows and detailed validation
- **Tablet:** Touch-optimized viewing with drill-down capabilities but no data entry
- **Mobile:** Thumb-friendly status checking with swipe navigation and push notification handling

**Rationale for Simplified Approach:** Financial contract processing requires full document context, detailed validation, and audit trail creation that cannot be safely accomplished on smaller screens. This focused strategy ensures development resources prioritize the primary desktop workflow while providing appropriate monitoring capabilities for management and emergency status checks.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful Motion Only:** Every animation must serve a functional purpose - indicating progress, confirming actions, or guiding user attention. No decorative animations that distract from financial accuracy requirements.

**Performance First:** All animations must maintain 60fps performance and can be disabled via user preferences or `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media query for accessibility compliance.

**Professional Restraint:** Subtle, business-appropriate motion that builds confidence rather than drawing attention to interface cleverness.

### Key Animations

- **Form Section Expand/Collapse:** Smooth height transition when contract type toggles reveal/hide sections (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Confidence Score Updates:** Gentle fade-in for new confidence percentages during Style matching (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-in-out)  
- **Balance Change Indicators:** Subtle pulse animation for balance updates in dashboard (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **PDF Processing Progress:** Linear progress bar with smooth fill animation during OCR extraction (Duration: based on actual progress, Easing: linear)
- **Validation State Transitions:** Color and icon changes for form field validation with smooth transitions (Duration: 100ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Success Confirmation:** Brief check mark animation on successful contract submission (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens for dashboard cards and form loading with subtle shimmer effect (Duration: 1500ms loop, Easing: ease-in-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** <2 seconds for initial dashboard load, <3 seconds for contract processing interface
- **Interaction Response:** <200ms for form interactions, <500ms for Style matching results
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps for all animations with graceful degradation on slower devices

### Design Strategies

**Optimized Asset Loading:** PDF viewer uses progressive loading for large documents, images optimized with Next.js Image component, fonts subset to include only required characters for data display.

**Efficient State Management:** On-demand balance calculations with manual refresh controls, form auto-save throttled to prevent excessive API calls, Style matching results memoized to avoid repeated API requests.

**Performance-First Architecture:** Critical rendering path optimized for desktop workflow, non-essential features lazy-loaded, database queries optimized for Style lookup performance with proper indexing.
