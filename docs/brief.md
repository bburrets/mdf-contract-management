# Project Brief: MDF Contract Management System

## Executive Summary

The **MDF Contract Management System** is a comprehensive digital platform designed to replace manual MDF (Marketing Development Fund) contract processing with an automated intake, validation, and ledger management system for FAMBrands Club division. The system addresses critical operational inefficiencies in contract processing where manual handling leads to costly errors, extensive time investment in remittance management, and reconciliation challenges between expected MDF allocations and actual finance charges.

**Primary Problem:** Arkansas Operations teams currently manage MDF contracts through manual processes involving Excel spreadsheets and email workflows, resulting in frequent attribution errors, time-intensive remittance processing, and difficulty reconciling Costco Item Numbers/Descriptions to internal FAM Style Numbers.

**Target Users:** FAMBrands Club division staff, Arkansas Operations teams, Accounts Receivable personnel, and Finance stakeholders who need accurate, real-time visibility into MDF contract commitments and actual spending.

**Key Value Proposition:** Transform weeks of manual contract processing into minutes of automated intake with human validation, eliminate attribution errors through intelligent style matching, and provide authoritative ledger tracking that automatically reconciles provisional commitments with actual finance charges.

## Problem Statement

**Current State Workflow Breakdown:**

**Step 1: Contract Receipt & Initial Processing**
- MDF contracts arrive as PDF documents via email only
- Operations staff manually open, validate, and store documents before routing to appropriate personnel via email
- No standardized intake tracking system exists outside of the current tracker for managing the ledger for OCS contracts

**Step 2: Data Extraction & Interpretation**
- Staff manually read through contract documents to extract key data points
- Critical fields include: Item Number, Item Description, contract value, channel designation (Inline/E-commerce/Both), campaign dates, partner information
- No OCR or automated extraction capabilities - purely manual interpretation
- Risk of transcription errors at every data point

**Step 3: Style Matching Challenge (Core Bottleneck)**
- Costco provides Item Numbers and Item Descriptions that don't directly match FAM's internal Style Numbers
- Staff must cross-reference against Style master data manually using spreadsheets or database queries
- No confidence scoring or systematic matching algorithms
- Multiple potential matches require judgment calls without clear decision criteria
- Failed matches result in contract processing delays while teams seek clarification

**Step 4: Channel Allocation Processing**
- "Both Channels" contracts contain specific amounts for individual Inline and E-commerce channels
- Staff must manually enter the channel-specific amounts as provided in the contract
- No validation required since contracts specify individual channel amounts rather than totals requiring splits

**Step 5: Ledger Entry & Reconciliation**
- Provisional amounts entered into Excel-based tracking systems
- No automated connection to finance systems for actual spending data
- Month-end reconciliation requires manual matching of provisional entries against actual invoices
- Discrepancies require investigation and manual corrections

**Quantified Pain Points (Observable Impacts):**

- **Processing Cycle Time:** Individual contracts can take 3-5 business days from receipt to final ledger entry
- **Error Cascades:** Single attribution error affects style-level balance calculations, potentially impacting multiple downstream funding decisions  
- **Reconciliation Overhead:** Month-end processes require dedicated staff time to manually match hundreds of provisional entries against actual finance charges
- **Audit Trail Gaps:** No systematic tracking of decision rationale, corrections, or process exceptions

**Seasonal/Volume Amplifiers:**
- Peak promotional periods (holidays, back-to-school) create contract volume spikes that overwhelm manual processes
- End-of-quarter timing pressures compound error risks when staff rush through validations
- Staff turnover creates knowledge gaps in Style matching expertise

**Stakeholder-Specific Impacts:**
- **Arkansas Operations:** Difficulty providing accurate funding status to sales stakeholders; frustration with repetitive manual tasks; exorbitant overtime during peak periods to maintain existing tracker sheet and process
- **Finance:** Delayed month-end closes; difficulty validating spending against budgets because they're not subject matter experts; lack accurate tools for matching invoices to existing styles and ongoing campaigns/contracts
- **Club FAM:** Reduced agility and damage to customer relationships

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
Current Excel-based tracking lacks integration with master data systems, provides no automated validation, and cannot scale with business growth. Existing systems don't address the core challenge of Costco identifier → FAM Style Number matching that drives accurate attribution.

**Urgency Drivers:**
Growing contract volume, increasing complexity of multi-channel allocations, and stakeholder demand for real-time funding visibility make manual processes unsustainable. The absence of systematic reconciliation creates financial control risks that compound over time.

## Proposed Solution

The **MDF Contract Management System** transforms manual contract processing through an intelligent, automated platform that maintains human oversight where business judgment is critical.

**Core Solution Architecture:**

**1. Automated Contract Intake with OCR Intelligence**
- Drag-and-drop PDF upload interface with automated OCR/Document Understanding extraction
- Intelligent extraction of Item Numbers, Item Descriptions, contract values, channel designations, campaign dates, and partner information
- Side-by-side contract preview with extracted data for validation and correction

**2. AI-Powered Style Matching Engine**
- Advanced matching algorithms that correlate Costco Item Numbers and Item Descriptions to FAM Style Numbers
- Confidence scoring system (≥90% for auto-selection, <90% presented with confidence percentage for user review)
- Integration with Style master data and OCS contract linkages for validation context
- Fallback manual search and selection interface when automated matching fails

**3. Channel-Aware Allocation Management**
- Automated detection of single-channel vs. "Both Channels" contract designations  
- For Both Channels contracts: creation of separate Inline and E-commerce allocation records using contract-specified amounts
- Real-time validation ensuring all required fields are populated before submission

**4. Authoritative Ledger System**
- Append-only ledger architecture serving as single source of truth for all financial transactions
- Provisional commitment tracking that transitions to actual spending through finance reconciliation
- Real-time balance calculations derived from ledger entries (never stored as running totals)
- Support for partial reconciliation and multiple finance charges per MDF contract

**5. Finance Integration & Reconciliation**
- Manual reconciliation workflow for MVP with systematic matching of provisional entries to actual finance charges
- Excel/CSV import capabilities for finance remittance data processing
- Audit trail maintenance through complete transaction lineage from contract to final reconciliation

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Human-AI Collaboration:** Automated efficiency with human validation for critical business decisions
- **Confidence-Based UX:** Transparent AI confidence scoring empowers users to make informed decisions
- **Style-Centric Design:** Built around FAM's Style Number architecture with OCS integration
- **Audit-First Architecture:** Complete traceability from contract intake through final reconciliation
- **Channel Intelligence:** Native understanding of Inline/E-commerce allocation complexities

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
Unlike generic contract management systems, this solution addresses the specific challenge of Costco identifier mapping to FAM Style Numbers while respecting existing business processes and stakeholder expertise. The system amplifies human judgment rather than replacing it, ensuring accuracy while dramatically improving efficiency.
