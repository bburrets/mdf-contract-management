# Goals and Background Context

## Goals (MVP-Focused)
- Reduce MDF contract processing time from 3-5 business days to 1-2 business days through automated OCR extraction and intelligent style matching
- Achieve reliable Style attribution through AI-powered matching with manual validation workflow
- Create centralized digital archive replacing Excel-based tracking
- Provide simple funding balance visibility with manual refresh capability

## Background Context
The Arkansas Operations teams currently manage MDF contracts through manual processes involving Excel spreadsheets and email workflows, resulting in frequent attribution errors, time-intensive remittance processing, and difficulty reconciling Costco Item Numbers/Descriptions to internal FAM Style Numbers. Growing contract volume, increasing complexity of multi-channel allocations, and stakeholder demand for funding visibility make manual processes unsustainable, creating financial control risks that compound over time.
