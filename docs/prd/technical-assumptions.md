# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Simple Monorepo
Single repository with Next.js full-stack application, database migrations, and basic deployment configurations. Co-located frontend and backend code with shared types.

## Service Architecture
**Next.js Full-Stack with Standard PostgreSQL** - Next.js App Router providing both frontend and API routes in single deployment, standard PostgreSQL database with basic authentication, simple file upload handling, and focus on reliability over real-time features.

## Testing Requirements
**Essential Testing** - Unit tests for business logic using Vitest, integration tests for API routes, and basic end-to-end tests using Playwright for critical user flows.

## Additional Technical Assumptions

**Backend Platform:** Next.js API routes handle all backend logic including file upload endpoints, Azure AI Document Intelligence integration, Style matching logic, and database operations. Standard authentication middleware and basic error handling.

**Frontend Platform:** Next.js App Router with standard React components, providing optimized rendering and client-server integration. Simple deployment with standard hosting.

**Database:** Standard PostgreSQL with Next.js integration providing direct database access through API routes, basic authentication, and simple connection pooling.

**OCR Integration:** Azure AI Document Intelligence integrated through Next.js API routes with manual fallback for low-confidence extractions. Add additional providers only after proving core workflow.

**Deployment & Scaling:** Simple deployment solution with standard hosting, basic monitoring, and manual scaling during peak periods.

**File Processing:** Next.js built-in file upload capabilities with PDF storage and basic CSV import processing through API routes.

**Authentication & Security:** Standard authentication system, environment variable management, data encryption, and basic audit logging.
