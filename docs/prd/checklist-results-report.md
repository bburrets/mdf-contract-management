# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary
- **Overall PRD Completeness:** 90% (MVP-focused)
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Right-sized for 8-week delivery
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
- **Most Critical Success Factor:** Reliable OCR integration with cost control

## MVP Scope Assessment
**Appropriately Scoped:** The simplified approach focuses on core value delivery - reducing processing time from 3-5 days to 1-2 days through automation while maintaining reliability and user control.

**Technical Complexity:** Manageable with Next.js/PostgreSQL/Azure AI stack providing proven solutions with minimal vendor lock-in risk.

## Recommendations
1. **Proceed with MVP architecture** - PRD provides clear guidance for simple, reliable implementation
2. **Focus on OCR reliability** - Single provider approach reduces complexity while proving core value
3. **Plan Phase 2 based on user feedback** - Add complexity only when justified by actual usage
4. **Maintain upgrade path** - Simple architecture can evolve to complex features when needed

**FINAL DECISION: READY FOR MVP ARCHITECTURE** - The PRD focuses on essential features with clear success metrics and realistic technical approach.
