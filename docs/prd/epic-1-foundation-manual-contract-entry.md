# Epic 1: Foundation & Manual Contract Entry

**Goal:** Establish core platform infrastructure with Next.js and PostgreSQL while providing immediate contract processing capability through manual data entry, enabling users to begin processing MDF contracts without waiting for OCR development.

## Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup
As a developer,
I want to initialize the Next.js project with PostgreSQL integration and deployment pipeline,
So that we have a solid foundation for building the MDF Contract Management System.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Next.js project created with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration
2. PostgreSQL database configured with connection from Next.js application
3. Basic deployment pipeline established with staging and production environments
4. Simple project structure with components, pages, and API routes folders
5. Environment variables configured for database connection and authentication

**Status:** Done ✅ (QA Gate: PASS - Quality Score: 90)

## Story 1.2: Basic User Authentication System
As an Arkansas Operations team member,
I want to securely log into the MDF system with my credentials,
So that I can access contract processing functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Simple authentication system with email/password
2. Login page with form validation
3. Protected routes requiring authentication to access
4. Basic user session management
5. Simple role-based access (Operations, Finance roles)

**Status:** Done ✅ (QA Gate: PASS - Quality Score: 92)

## Story 1.3: Manual Contract Data Entry Form
As an Arkansas Operations team member,
I want to manually enter MDF contract data through a comprehensive form,
So that I can process contracts immediately without waiting for OCR capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Contract intake form with required fields (Style, Date Taken, Funding Type, Total Amount, Campaign Dates)
2. Form validation preventing submission of invalid data
3. Style search and selection interface with autocomplete
4. Channel handling with Both Channels allocation interface
5. Form saves and allows resuming incomplete entries

**Status:** Done ✅ (QA Gate: PASS - Quality Score: 95)

## Story 1.4: Basic Contract Storage
As an Arkansas Operations team member,
I want my manually entered contract data to be securely stored and retrievable,
So that I can maintain records of all processed MDF contracts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. PostgreSQL database schema for contracts, allocations, and ledger entries
2. API endpoints for creating and retrieving contract records
3. Data persistence with validation and error handling
4. Basic contract listing page showing processed contracts
5. Simple audit trail capturing user actions and timestamps

**Status:** Done ✅ (QA Gate: CONCERNS → Resolved in Story 1.5)

## Story 1.5: Priority Issues Fixes - Brownfield Addition
As a developer maintaining the MDF Contract Management System,
I want to address the priority issues identified in Story 1.4 QA review,
So that the contract storage system has proper data integrity, error handling, and documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Add missing 'allocation_delete' action to processing_audit.action_type CHECK constraint
2. Add request timeout handling to ContractList.tsx fetchContracts function
3. Add JSDoc comments to service layer functions for API documentation clarity
4. Existing contract storage and audit functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New timeout handling follows existing error handling patterns
6. Documentation additions maintain current TypeScript patterns
7. Changes are covered by appropriate unit tests
8. Database migration maintains existing audit trail functionality
9. No regression in existing contract processing functionality verified

**Status:** Done ✅ (QA Gate: PASS - Quality Score: 100)
