# Epic 3: Style Matching & Validation

**Goal:** Implement AI-powered Style matching engine that correlates Costco Item Numbers and Item Descriptions to FAM Style Numbers with confidence scoring, enabling accurate contract attribution while maintaining human validation.

## Story 3.1: Style Master Data Integration
As a developer,
I want to connect to the Style Master Data system,
So that the application can access current Style information for matching operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. PostgreSQL database schema for Style master data with indexing
2. Data import mechanism from existing Style Master Data system
3. Style search API endpoints with fuzzy matching
4. Performance optimization for Style lookups under 2-second response times
5. OCS contract linkage data integrated with Style records

## Story 3.2: Basic Style Search Interface
As an Arkansas Operations team member,
I want to search and select FAM Style Numbers when processing contracts,
So that I can accurately attribute MDF contracts to the correct styles.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Style search interface with autocomplete and filtering
2. Search results display Style Number, description, and OCS status
3. Style selection populates contract form with validated information
4. Recent and frequently used styles quick-select options
5. Manual Style entry option for edge cases

## Story 3.3: Automated Item Matching Engine
As an Arkansas Operations team member,
I want the system to suggest FAM Style matches based on Costco Item Numbers and Descriptions,
So that I can quickly validate correct attributions without manual searching.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Matching algorithm using exact and fuzzy matching
2. Confidence scoring system with â‰¥90% threshold for auto-selection
3. Multiple match results with confidence percentages
4. Pre-selected highest confidence match with alternatives
5. No-match scenarios handled with manual search fallback
