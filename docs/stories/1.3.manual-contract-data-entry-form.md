### Technical Constraints
**Form Validation Requirements** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]:
- Client-side validation using Zod schemas for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation for security and data integrity
- Proper error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks

**Performance Considerations**:
- Implement debounced search for style autocomplete
- Use React Query for caching style search results
- Auto-save drafts with optimistic updates
- Lazy load style suggestions to improve initial page load

### Form Field Requirements
**Required Contract Fields** [Based on Epic 1 acceptance criteria]:
1. **Style Selection** - Style number with autocomplete search
2. **Date Taken** - Contract effective date (date picker)
3. **Funding Type** - Channel or AllStyle scope selection
4. **Total Amount** - Total committed amount (currency input with validation)
5. **Campaign Dates** - Start and end dates for campaign period
6. **Customer** - Optional customer/retailer name
7. **Channel Allocation** - Inline/Ecomm percentage or amount distribution

**Validation Rules**:
- Style must exist in styles table
- Total amount must be positive decimal
- Campaign end date must be after start date
- Channel allocation must total 100% or full amount
- All required fields must be completed before submission

### Draft Functionality Specifications
**Auto-Save Behavior**:
- Save draft every 30 seconds when form has changes
- Save on field blur for critical fields
- Visual indication of save status (saved/saving/error)
- Conflict resolution if multiple sessions editing same draft

**Resume Functionality**:
- Load most recent draft on form initialization
- Preserve validation state and errors
- Handle partially completed style suggestions
- Clear draft after successful submission

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests: Co-located with components using `.test.tsx` suffix
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/contract-form/` directory
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/contract-entry.spec.ts` using Playwright

**Testing Frameworks** [From Stories 1.1-1.2]:
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing
- **Form Testing**: React Hook Form testing utilities

**Testing Requirements for This Story**:
- Test form field validation (individual fields and cross-field validation)
- Test style search autocomplete functionality
- Test channel allocation calculations and validation
- Test draft save/resume functionality with various scenarios
- Test complete contract submission workflow
- E2E test covering entire manual entry process from start to finish

**Form Testing Patterns**:
- Test form submission with valid and invalid data
- Test field-level validation and error display
- Test draft persistence and recovery
- Test style selection and autocomplete behavior
- Test allocation percentage calculations
- Test loading states and error handling
