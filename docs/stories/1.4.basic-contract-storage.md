### Technical Constraints
**Data Integrity Requirements** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]:
- Use database transactions for multi-table operations (contract + allocations)
- Implement proper foreign key constraints and referential integrity
- Add comprehensive validation at both client and server levels
- Use connection pooling for optimal database performance
- Implement proper error handling with rollback capabilities

**Security Requirements**:
- Role-based access control for contract operations
- Audit all data modifications with user identification
- Validate user permissions before allowing data access
- Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries for database operations

**Performance Considerations**:
- Implement pagination for contract listings to handle large datasets
- Use database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Cache contract counts and summary data with React Query
- Optimize allocation balance calculations with database views
- Add search functionality with proper indexing

### Contract Storage Workflow
**Contract Creation Process**:
1. Validate incoming contract data against schema
2. Check style_number exists in styles table
3. Begin database transaction
4. Create contract record in mdf_contracts table
5. Create allocation records for each channel
6. Log audit trail entry for contract creation
7. Commit transaction or rollback on failure
8. Return success response with created contract details

**Contract Retrieval Process**:
1. Apply user role-based access filters
2. Parse query parameters for filtering and pagination
3. Execute optimized database query with joins
4. Include allocation details and balance calculations
5. Return paginated results with metadata
6. Cache frequently accessed contract data

### Audit Trail Specifications
**Audit Event Types for Contracts**:
- `contract_create` - New contract creation
- `contract_update` - Contract modification
- `contract_delete` - Contract deletion
- `allocation_create` - Allocation creation
- `allocation_update` - Allocation modification
- `contract_view` - Contract access (for sensitive data)

**Audit Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface AuditEntry {
  audit_id: number;
  contract_id?: number;
  action_type: string;
  user_id: string;
  action_data: {
    before?: any;        // Previous state
    after?: any;         // New state
    changes?: string[];  // Changed fields
  };
  user_decisions?: {
    overrides?: string[];
    validations?: string[];
  };
  timestamp: string;
}
```

### Improvements Checklist

**Priority Issues Requiring Attention:**

- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add allocation_delete action to migration CHECK constraint (allocation_delete missing from processing_audit.action_type)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add request timeout handling in ContractList.tsx fetchContracts function
- [ ] **LOW**: Consider adding database connection pooling configuration visibility
- [ ] **LOW**: Add JSDoc comments to service layer functions for better API documentation

**Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):**

### Security Review

**Security Status: PASS with Minor Recommendations**

✅ **Secure Practices Implemented:**
- Parameterized queries preventing SQL injection
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- Role-based access control structure in place
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

**Minor Security Considerations:**
- Authentication relies on NextAuth session - ensure proper session management
- Consider adding rate limiting for API endpoints (future enhancement)
- Audit trail data should be encrypted at rest (infrastructure concern)

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Status: PASS - Well Optimized**

✅ **Performance Optimizations:**
- Proper database indexing on frequently queried columns
- Pagination implemented for large datasets
- Database views for complex allocation balance calculations
- Component-level state management avoiding unnecessary re-renders

**Performance Monitoring Recommendations:**
- Monitor query performance as data volume grows
- Consider N+1 query patterns in contract-allocation joins
- Frontend pagination may need server-side search optimization
