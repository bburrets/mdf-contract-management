## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- NextAuth.js is already configured in src/lib/auth.ts but needs providers added
- PostgreSQL database with connection pooling is ready in src/lib/db.ts
- Environment validation with Zod is implemented in src/lib/env.ts  
- Testing framework (Vitest + Playwright) is fully configured
- Basic UI components and layout structure exist in src/components/

### Data Models
**User Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]:
```typescript
interface User {
  user_id: string;        // Primary key
  email: string;          // Unique, for authentication
  full_name: string;      // Display name
  role: 'operations' | 'finance' | 'admin';  // Role-based access
  is_active: boolean;     // Account status
  created_at: string;     // Audit timestamp
  last_login?: string;    // Last login tracking
}
```

### Database Schema
**Users Table** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  email          TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  full_name      TEXT NOT NULL,
  role           TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'operations' 
                 CHECK (role IN ('operations', 'finance', 'admin')),
  is_active      BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  last_login     TIMESTAMPTZ
);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON users(role);
```

### API Specifications
No specific authentication endpoints defined in api-specification.md. Follow NextAuth.js standard patterns:
- `/api/auth/signin` - Login endpoint  
- `/api/auth/signout` - Logout endpoint
- `/api/auth/session` - Session management
- `/api/users/*` - User management endpoints

### Component Specifications  
**Authentication Components** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
- Use React Hook Form for form state management
- Implement loading states and error handling
- Follow component organization pattern in src/components/
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling consistency
- Apply standard useState patterns for simple UI state
